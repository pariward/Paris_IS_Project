    <h4>I wasn't sure what to make a website on, so I decided to make one on popsicles. Why? Because during my first two semesters at college
        I ate over 250 popsicles. I love popsicles. They make the world go round. They are truly the perfect snack. I mean first off, who doesn't love ice cream? 
        Okay maybe a few people (1% to be exact). But ice cream can be a hassle sometimes. They take up a ton of space in your freezer. Not to mention the workout
        that you get when you have to get a scoop of slightly overly frozen ice cream. Then you have to get a bowl and a spoon dirty, and you have to wash it once you are 
        done. It is just a huge hassle. But popsicles?? Don't take up as much space in the freezer, and you can just fit it inbetween those two frozen burritos you bought in 
        2019. Plus no clean up? No extra work?? Popsicles are simply incredible. So here is a blog about popsicles.

    <h3 id="his">History</h3>
        The popsicle, also known as an ice pop, is a popular frozen treat enjoyed by people all over the world. The origin of the popsicle can be traced back to 1905, when an 11-year-old boy named Frank Epperson accidentally left a mixture of soda powder and water with a stirring stick outside overnight. The mixture froze and the following day, Epperson discovered the frozen treat that he named the "Epsicle." He continued to make the treats for his friends and family, and eventually patented the idea in 1923, calling it the "Popsicle."
        The Popsicle quickly gained popularity, and by the 1930s, it was being mass-produced and sold by the millions. During World War II, Popsicle production was put on hold due to sugar rationing, but it quickly regained popularity once the war was over. In the 1950s, Popsicle introduced its famous multi-flavor "Rainbow" popsicle, which quickly became a fan favorite. <br><br>
        Over the years, the Popsicle has continued to evolve and expand its flavors and varieties. In addition to the traditional fruit flavors, Popsicle now offers a range of cream-based popsicles, as well as sugar-free and low-calorie options. The brand has also introduced licensed characters and themed popsicles, such as Marvel superheroes and Star Wars characters. <br><br>
        Today, the Popsicle is a beloved frozen treat enjoyed by people of all ages. It has become an iconic part of American culture, with its classic packaging and jingle ("Popsicle, Popsicle, Fudgsicle, Creamsicle") being instantly recognizable. From its humble beginnings as an accidental invention, the popsicle has become a symbol of summer and a staple of childhood memories.

    <h3 id="Stats">Stats</h3>
      I couldnt find any public tableau that had to do with popsicles that would fit into my blog. I was able to find a data sheet with how many popsicles per year are eaten by each country, but it costed like 5 k and so I will not be purchasing that. So enjoy a semi interesting dashboard that talks about ice cream.
